Picked up my share of a cow I had gone in on with a friend of mine. Originally
we were each going to end up with ~190lbs of meat! But it came up a little
short, so I think we received about 95lbs each. I had bought a little 5cf
freezer off craigslist for $60, and it all fit in there with room to spare.

We had some burgers out of the ground chuck yesterday. It's a bit leaner than I
usually buy, I think it's around 90%. That makes sense, because the cow was a
dairy cow before it ran out of milk (sorry cow!), so I suppose it wouldn't be as
disgustingly overweight as a meat cow.

Made delicious burgers, really fresh tasting. I cooked them the usual way, in
the cast iron, smashed style.
