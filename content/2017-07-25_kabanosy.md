[Kabanosy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabanos) are thin Polish smoked and
dried sausages. I haven't done any dry cured meats since the largely failed
salami/landjäger attempt in 2012, when I tried to dry cure about 30# of meat in
a minifridge, with a fan and a bowl of water to roughly manage humidity.

However I think the temperature may have been too high, or there wasn't enough
airflow, and there were issues with contamination, yuck.

THIS time around, I went for something more basic- these are thin sausages that
take a hot smoke (150°F), and only about 4-5 days of drying time. They're a salt
cure only, no culture or fermentation. I used these two recipes as guidelines
(particularly, getting the nitrite and salt to meat ratios correct is
important)-

I added mustard seed, about 1.5 tablespoons, and used mace instead of nutmeg. I
also started with about 2.5# of pork butt, which had plenty of fat, so I didn't
add any extra.

So final recipe ended up approximately like this:

> 1200 grams (2.5#) of pork butt 25 grams salt 3 grams Cure #1 4 grams black
> pepper 2 grams caraway seeds 2 grams mace 4 grams sugar 1/3 cup ice water

I smoked them over cherry (chips) for about 1.5 hours only, I only have a round
weber grill I use to smoke, with aluminum foil to indirect the heat a bit, but
it's a really poor setup for slow smoking anything.

Stuffed them into ~22mm sheep casings (from butcher & packer... couldn't find
any locally) yielded about 10 pairs of 10-12" links, here's a shot of them
before they went in the smoker-

Dried them just open in the fridge on some wire racks (thanks wife for
tolerating!) for 5 days.
