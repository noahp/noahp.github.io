# civetweb Authentication

[civetweb](https://github.com/civetweb/civetweb)Â is a basic http server that can
be handy for quickly serving files, for example. It actually has a surprisingly
rich feature set, which includes fine-grained authentication. Here's an example
for setting up global authentication for the server.

\# to generate a new password file- civetweb64.exe -A .htpasswd localhost admin
admin

\# start the server with that password civetweb64.exe -global_auth_file
.htpasswd

\# test in browser, or curl- curl.exe --digest -u mydomain.com\\admin:admin
http://localhost:8080/somefile.file

That's it! The civetweb docs describe other options for authentication.
