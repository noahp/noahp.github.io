# Beer batch #6 bottling

## Bottling

Yesterday (2015-10-21) I bottled the pseudo-red ipa I brewed on 2015-10-07.

My bottling setup is a 5gl food safe bucket from Lowe's with a spigot attached.
Manual bottling is pretty labor intensive, I really want to switch to kegging or
at least figure out a way to automatically dispense the correct amount of beer
to load into a bottle.

It takes me about 1hr (had some help this time!) to bottle a 5gl batch, yields
about 40ish bottles. This batch I used 36 12oz bottles and a handful of 22oz
bottles.

Priming sugar- just table sugar, a little less than 1/2 cup for a 5gl batch. I
should be using corn sugar or dextrose for more neutral flavor, table sugar adds
a little caramel flavor that I don't like in an IPA. If I was really serious I
would prime with some pure wort saved from sparging, someday.

## Recipe

This is the recipe I used, copied from some examples I found online, plus some
wildcard changes. Didn't end up quite as red as I was hoping, I really need to
use a few oz of chocolate malt to get that effect.

9# 2row pale 1# caramel 40LB 1# carahell 1# caramunich type 2 1# carared 1oz
amarillo, start of boil 1oz amarillo, 30 min (50%) boil 2oz centennial dry
hopped at start of primary

2 weeks in primary (forgot to take pictures), nice krausen floating on top.
Tasted it during bottling, flavor seems good, nice hoppy finish. I'm hoping the
bottles will clear up a bit more, the raw beer was somewhat cloudy (I don't like
to use fining agents though).
