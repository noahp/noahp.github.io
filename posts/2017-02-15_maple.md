# Maple

Making maple syrup super small scale. Bought these taps off ebay-

And bought a few food-grade 5gl buckets and lids, and some acrylic tubing from
Lowe's.

Some good tips on several US school agriculture extension website. The one I
mostly used was from Cornell:

1.  drilled holes in bucket lids for hoses
2.  cut tubing to size; I'm just leaving the buckets on the ground, results in
    more likely frozen sap but I'm lazy
3.  these taps just friction fit into the tubing, easy.
4.  drill a hole in the tree, slightly angled upwards, about 1.5" deep (the taps
    only need like 1/2" to set properly)
5.  install

You'll only get sap flow on days with below freezing nights and above freezing
nights. We had a few warm (40s!) days, I had two days with nearly 5gallons of
sap. After boiling those two batches I ended up with the following delicious
stuff:
