      <h2>Another current sensor</h2>
      <p>Building out a pretty basic low-power 2 channel current+voltage meter, based around the very nice <a href="http://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/PAC1720">PAC1720</a>.</p>
<p>I'm using another Microchip part, MCP2221A, as the USB-I2C bridge. Simple little design but should allow me to perform some automated current+voltage measurements on LVDC type circuits.</p>
<p>The PAC1720 part is about $2/piece from Mouser/Digikey, same for the MCP2221A, so BOM ends up around $7.50 including OSH fab. Pretty reasonable for the accuracy and range provided by the PAC1720.</p>
<p>One interesting thing I found is that the MCP2221A uses USB-HID for I2C comms (vs CDC via bulk transfer), surprising, but nice, means the driver situation is easy.</p>
