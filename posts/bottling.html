      <h2>Beer batch #6 bottling</h2>
      <h2>Bottling</h2>
<p>Yesterday (2015-10-21) I bottled the pseudo-red ipa I brewed on 2015-10-07.</p>
<p>My bottling setup is a 5gl food safe bucket from Lowe's with a spigot attached. Manual bottling is pretty labor intensive, I really want to switch to kegging or at least figure out a way to automatically dispense the correct amount of beer to load into a bottle.</p>
<p>It takes me about 1hr (had some help this time!) to bottle a 5gl batch, yields about 40ish bottles. This batch I used 36 12oz bottles and a handful of 22oz bottles.</p>

<p>Priming sugar- just table sugar, a little less than 1/2 cup for a 5gl batch. I should be using corn sugar or dextrose for more neutral flavor, table sugar adds a little caramel flavor that I don't like in an IPA. If I was really serious I would prime with some pure wort saved from sparging, someday.</p>

<h2>Recipe</h2>
<p>This is the recipe I used, copied from some examples I found online, plus some wildcard changes. Didn't end up quite as red as I was hoping, I really need to use a few oz of chocolate malt to get that effect.</p>
<p>9#  2row pale
1#  caramel 40LB
1#  carahell
1#  caramunich type 2
1#  carared
1oz  amarillo, start of boil
1oz  amarillo, 30 min (50%) boil
2oz  centennial dry hopped at start of primary</p>
<p>2 weeks in primary (forgot to take pictures), nice krausen floating on top. Tasted it during bottling, flavor seems good, nice hoppy finish. I'm hoping the bottles will clear up a bit more, the raw beer was somewhat cloudy (I don't like to use fining agents though).</p>
