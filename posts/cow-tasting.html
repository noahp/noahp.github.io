      <h2>Cow tasting</h2>
      <p>Picked up my share of a cow I had gone in on with a friend of mine. Originally we were each going to end up with ~190lbs of meat! But it came up a little short, so I think we received about 95lbs each. I had bought a little 5cf freezer off craigslist for $60, and it all fit in there with room to spare.</p>

<p>We had some burgers out of the ground chuck yesterday. It's a bit leaner than I usually buy, I think it's around 90%. That makes sense, because the cow was a dairy cow before it ran out of milk (sorry cow!), so I suppose it wouldn't be as disgustingly overweight as a meat cow.</p>
<p>Made delicious burgers, really fresh tasting. I cooked them the usual way, in the cast iron, smashed style.</p>
