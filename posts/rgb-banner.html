      <h2>RGB Banner</h2>
      <p>This is a project I’ve been working on very slowly over the last couple of months-</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-37j8mFwZZ4w/VgrL_FAz7aI/AAAAAAAAEn0/Ldr4Qx53qSk/s1600/blink.gif"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-37j8mFwZZ4w/VgrL_FAz7aI/AAAAAAAAEn0/Ldr4Qx53qSk/s320/blink.gif" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>The module above is a ~56*96mm PCB with 84 WS2812B RGB LEDs mounted. These LEDs are about $0.12 per on ebay/aliexpress, about 3x the price of normal RGB LEDs. However these ones are serial addressable and internally maintain a 24-bit color value (PWM’d even!), so it saves a lot of work multiplexing the emitters.</p>
<p>I eventually want to populate at least 4 of the modules and string them together, controlled by an ESP8266 WiFi module, to display weather and time information, or something like that.</p>
<p>Everything’s in my <a href="https://github.com/noahp/lightBar">github</a>.</p>
